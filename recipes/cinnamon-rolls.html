            Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.
        </li>
        <li>Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead on medium speed for 8 minutes, until 
            it forms into a ball, but it still slightly sticky.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer dough to oiled bowl, and cover with plastic and a warm towel for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours 
            until the dough has doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer dough to floured surface and roll into a 14x9" rectangle. 
            Spread softened butter over the dough, leaving a 1/4 inch margin.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon. sprinkle the mixture over the 
            buttered dough and rub the brown sugar into the butter with your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Roll up the dough tightly starting from the 9 inch side, and make sure to cut off an inch of dough
            from both ends, after rolled up.
        </li>
        <li>Slice the rolled up dough into 1 inch sections. This should give you about 9 rolls</li>
        <li>Place the cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 baking pan, lined with parchment paper.
            Cover with plastic wrap and warm towel and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake for 20-25 minutes, until
            slightly golden brown.
        </li>
        <li><strong>For the frosting:</strong> In an electric mixer (if you have one), combine the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and 
            vanilla extract. Beat with a paddle attachment until smooth and fluffy. Spread over the cinnamon rolls
            and serve right away!
