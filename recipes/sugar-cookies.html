    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These delicious sugar cookies are baked to perfection! With crisp edges and thick soft centers, these sugar 
       cookies are perfect for any occasion. This recipe is perfect if you're looking to get a clean cut shape, without
       the cookies over expanding in the oven. The dough is ready to be used right away, or can be frozen for later use.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 (170g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract <em>(This is optional, but enhances flavor)</em></li>
        <li>Royal icing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside</li>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, until
            smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract <em>(optional)</em> and 
            beat on high speed until combined.
        </li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients from bowl, into the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined.
            Dough should be soft. Add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 parts. Place each on lightly floured parchment paper or silicone baking mat <em>(recommended)</em> 
        and roll the dough to about 1/4" thickness.
        </li>
        <li>Lightly dust one of the doughs with flour, and place parchment paper on the top.</li>
        <li>Place the 2nd rolled out dough on top and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours, 
            or up to 2 days, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>After the dough is chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees F and line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper, 
            or silicone baking mats. Remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator and cut the dough into shapes, using your
            preferred cookie cutter. <em>Remember to re-roll scrap pieces until all the dough is used.</em>
        </li>
        <li>Arrange cookies on baking sheet, about 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes until lightly browned around
            the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Decorate the cookies with royal icing, as desired.</li>
        <li>Wait until icing hardens, or enjoy them right away!</li>
    </ol>
