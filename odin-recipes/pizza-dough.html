    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cups (320ml) warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons (7g) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (13g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups (450g) all purpose flour</li>
        <li>Sprinkle of cornmeal for dusting the pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar in stand mixer with dough hook attachment.
            Cover with a towel and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and flour to the bowl. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Take out the 
            dough and put onto floured surface and knead for 3-4 minutes, until dough is soft. Poke it with your finger,
            if it bounces back, it's ready! Otherwise, keep kneading.
        </li>
        <li>Lightly grease a large bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and 
            a warm towel, and allow dough to rise for 60-90 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F, allowing the oven to heat for 15-20 minutes. Lightly grease a baking sheet and sprinkle 
            with cornmeal. <em>This step is optional, but recommended!</em>
        </li>
        <li>After the dough has risen, punch it down to release air, and divide the dough in half. One a lightly floured surface 
            gently flatten the dough into a disc shape. Place the disc onto the baking sheet and with floured hands, gently stretch into
            a 12 inch circle. Pinch or fold over the edges to create a thick crust.
        </li>
        <li>Brush the top of the dough lightly with olive oil, and using your fingers put dents into the surface.
            Top with your favorite sauce and toppings and bake for 12-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
